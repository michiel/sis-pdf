# Schema Changelog

## 2026-02-21

- Removed finding field `reader_impacts` from report/query payloads.
- Removed metadata keys generated by reader-context enrichment:
  - `reader.impact.<profile>`
  - `reader.impact.summary`

This is a pre-release schema change; external tooling should update to the new payload shape.
