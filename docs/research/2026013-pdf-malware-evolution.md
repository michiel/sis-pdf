# **Technical Analysis of Evolved Evasion and Passive Execution in Malicious Portable Document Format Architecture (2020-2026)**

The security landscape surrounding the Portable Document Format (PDF) has undergone a fundamental paradigm shift between 2020 and 2025\. While historical threats predominantly relied on direct memory corruption exploits or the execution of embedded JavaScript to deliver payloads, the contemporary era is defined by Highly Evasive Adaptable Threats (HEAT) and the weaponization of trusted system rendering pipelines.1 Statistical telemetry from the first half of 2025 indicates that 82% of all malicious file attacks are delivered via email, with PDF files frequently serving as the primary or secondary stage in these complex infection chains.3 The sophistication of these attacks has grown in tandem with the rise of Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) and the integration of generative artificial intelligence, which has lowered the technical barriers for adversaries while increasing the complexity of detection for static and dynamic analysis tools.4

## **The Contemporary Threat Landscape and Sector Exposure**

The evolution of PDF-based malware is inextricably linked to broader shifts in the cybercrime ecosystem. During the 2024-2025 period, there has been an 18% increase in general cyber-attacks and a 48% increase in ransomware activity, with the technology and healthcare sectors remaining the most targeted industries.3 In the technology sector alone, nearly half (46.75%) of observed breaches involved vulnerabilities in third-party products and software supply chains, where PDF documentation is often used as a vehicle for initial access.4

| Industry Sector | Observed Attack Increase (2024 vs 2023\) | Average Breach Cost (2025) | Primary Threat Vector |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Finance | 47% | $5.9 Million | Infostealers and Credential Harvesting 4 |
| Healthcare | 32% | $10.3 Million | Ransomware and Data Extortion 4 |
| Technology | 21% | $4.8 Million | Supply Chain and Vendor Relationship Exploits 4 |
| Government | 15% | $3.2 Million | Espionage and Disruption Campaigns 4 |

The emergence of remote work has exacerbated these risks. With 22.9% of the workforce operating in remote or hybrid environments as of early 2024, the security perimeter has effectively dissolved, making decentralized IT infrastructure a prime target for PDF-delivered Remote Access Trojans (RATs) and stealers.5 Threat actors have refined their social engineering tactics, utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize marketing materials and internal communications that appear indistinguishable from legitimate enterprise documentation, thereby increasing the likelihood that a user will interact with a malicious PDF.1

## **Structural Vulnerabilities and the RenderShock Framework**

The most significant advancement in post-2020 PDF exploitation is the shift from active exploitation (requiring user clicks) to passive execution, colloquially known as "zero-click" triggers. The "RenderShock" framework demonstrates how attackers weaponize the trust inherent in background file processing tasks such as previewing, indexing, and scanning.2 Modern operating systems like Windows and macOS automatically invoke registered preview handlers, such as the Windows Explorer Preview Pane or macOS Quick Look, to render file content in memory when a user merely selects or hovers over a file.2

The technical mechanism of RenderShock exploits the assumption that these background processes are safe interpreters of document data. However, for a PDF file, this passive interaction can trigger outbound connections to attacker-controlled infrastructure. This is achieved through several methods, including the embedding of external images or custom font files (TTF/WOFF) that force the rendering engine to resolve a remote Uniform Naming Convention (UNC) path or URL.2 When the system attempts to fetch these resources, it may inadvertently leak NTLMv2 hashes or provide a beacon that confirms the victim's environment to the attacker.2

### **Multi-Parser Ambiguity and Polyglot Construction**

Attackers have also refined the use of polyglot files—documents that are valid under multiple different parsers simultaneously—to bypass MIME filtering and confuse security scanners. Within the RenderShock framework, polyglots are used to simulate a zero-day adversarial mindset by creating files that act as both a PDF and a ZIP, or a PDF and an HTML document.2 This format ambiguity exploits the technical discrepancies between the scanner's interpretation and the actual target application's behavior. Research indicates that many popular antivirus scanners fail to detect these "Chameleon" and "Werewolf" attacks because their internal parsing engines are easily exhausted by the structural contradictions within the file.6

| Rendering Surface | Passive Trigger Mechanism | Adversarial Objective |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Windows Explorer Preview Pane | Resolution of embedded UNC paths | NTLM Credential Leak 2 |
| macOS Quick Look | Automatic rendering of thumbnails | Outbound Beaconing / Exfiltration 2 |
| Antivirus Scan Engines | Interpretation of malformed metadata | Parser Crash / Memory Corruption 2 |
| Search Indexing Services | Text extraction from malicious streams | Denial of Service / Remote Execution 2 |

## **Advanced Obfuscation: Fountain Codes and Information Entropy**

A critical trend in modern PDF malware is the adoption of information-theoretic obfuscation techniques to hide malicious shellcode. Conventional static analysis tools often look for patterns in XOR-encrypted or Base64-encoded payloads, but newer methods utilize fountain codes to break shellcode into numerous packets with independent structures.7 This approach makes it impossible to reconstruct the payload without specific knowledge of the initial seed value (![][image1]) and the index set (![][image2]) used during the encoding process.7

The entropy of these fountain-code-encoded packets approaches its maximum theoretical value, meaning that ![][image3].7 This high entropy effectively blinds statistical scanners, as the data appears to be random noise rather than a malicious payload. Furthermore, the integrity of the shellcode is maintained through redundancy, ensuring successful execution on the target system even if portions of the document stream are fragmented or modified during transit.7

| Obfuscation Parameter | Value / Metric | Security Implication |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Slice Size (![][image4]) | 64 \- 128 bits | Optimal balance between file size and decoding reliability 7 |
| Packet Independence (![][image5]) | ![][image6] Number of slices | Prevents reconstruction without full packet set 7 |
| Normalized Entropy (![][image7]) | ![][image8] 1.0 | Defeats statistical and pattern-based detection 7 |
| Decryption Dependency | Seed ![][image1] and Indices ![][image2] | Irreversible without specific attacker parameters 7 |

## **Remote Template Injection and Initial Access Paradigms**

While traditionally associated with Microsoft Office formats, remote template injection has evolved into a foundational payload for PDF-based initial access campaigns. This technique allows a document to remain benign at face value, containing no malicious macros or exploit markers that would trigger an email security gateway.1 Instead, the PDF serves as a decoy that, when rendered or opened, instructs the application to fetch a remote template containing the actual malicious code.8

This method is particularly effective against organizations that have implemented macro-blocking for external files, as the "no-macro" injection can be triggered during the preview phase in Outlook or File Explorer.1 In campaigns attributed to actors like ACTINIUM (also known as Primitive Bear), these lure documents are meticulously crafted to appear as legitimate government or military communiqués.8 The use of remote templates ensures that the malicious component is only loaded when a human user interacts with the file, thereby evading automated analysis environments that may not be configured to allow outbound network traffic to the attacker's Server Message Block (SMB) share or HTTP server.8

## **JavaScript Evasion, Fingerprinting, and Forced Execution**

Embedded JavaScript remains the most versatile component of the PDF format, but its application has shifted from simple heap-spraying to sophisticated environmental keying. Malicious JavaScript in the post-2020 era is heavily obfuscated and designed to remain dormant unless it detects a genuine victim environment.11 Research using the FV8 engine—a modified V8 JavaScript engine—has identified 28 unique evasion categories that malware authors use to bypass both static and dynamic analysis.11

### **Taxonomy of Modern JavaScript Evasions**

These evasion techniques are categorized into several groups based on the conditions they check before detonating the payload:

* **Timebombs:** The script delays execution until a specific date or until a significant amount of wall-clock time has passed, outlasting the typical timeout of a sandbox environment.11  
* **Fingerprinting:** The code probes for hardware characteristics such as the number of CPU cores, the amount of physical RAM, or specific GPU vendor strings that distinguish a physical machine from a virtualized one.2  
* **User Interaction:** Execution is gated behind specific events such as mouse movements, button clicks, or the filling of form fields within an /Acroform or /XFA structure.11  
* **Website Checks:** The malware attempts to resolve specific internal domain names or checks for the presence of security-related browser extensions to determine if it is being analyzed by a researcher.2

To counter these threats, the next generation of PDF analysis tools must employ "forced execution," a technique where the interpreter is modified to ignore environmental checks and execute all possible code paths.11 This approach has been shown to increase code coverage by 11% compared to standard engines, revealing millions of lines of previously invisible malicious logic.11

## **Case Study: The XFA and XXE Attack Chain (CVE-2025-66516)**

The complexity of the PDF specification's support for XML-based forms has introduced a critical new vulnerability class. In late 2025, a maximum-severity flaw (CVE-2025-66516) was identified in Apache Tika, a widely used framework for document parsing and metadata extraction.15 The vulnerability, carrying a CVSS score of 10.0, enables XML External Entity (XXE) injection through crafted XFA (XML Forms Architecture) files embedded within a PDF.15

The technical root cause of this vulnerability lies within the tika-core module, which fails to properly restrict external entity resolution when processing untrusted XML streams.16 An attacker can craft a PDF where the XFA structure contains a \<\!DOCTYPE\> declaration referencing sensitive local files (e.g., /etc/passwd or cloud metadata services).16 When a backend service ingests the PDF for search indexing or automated processing, the parser dereferences the entity, exfiltrating the data to an attacker-controlled endpoint.16

| Vulnerable Component | Version Range | Remediation Action |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| org.apache.tika:tika-core | 1.13 \- 3.2.1 | Upgrade to 3.2.2 or later 15 |
| org.apache.tika:tika-parsers | 1.13 \- 1.28.5 | Upgrade to 2.0.0 or later 15 |
| tika-parser-pdf-module | 2.0.0 \- 3.2.1 | Upgrade to 3.2.2 or later 15 |

The danger of this vulnerability is amplified by its low exploit complexity and the fact that it requires no special configuration to trigger; simply uploading a PDF to a vulnerable service is sufficient.17 This underscores the critical need for "Content Disarm and Reconstruction" (CDR) technology that can strip XFA forms and active XML content from PDFs before they reach sensitive backend parsers.18

## **3D Objects, Rich Media, and Structural Complexity**

The integration of 3D interactive views into the PDF format via Universal 3D (U3D) and Product Representation Compact (PRC) formats has introduced an additional layer of risk.19 These formats support hybrid representations of geometric data, combining exact B-rep (Boundary Representation) with compressed tessellated meshes.21 Historically, the parsers for these objects have been susceptible to array overflows and uninitialized memory vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2009-3953 and CVE-2011-2462.22

As organizations in sectors like defense and aerospace increasingly adopt PDF-based Technical Data Packages for sustainment and engineering, the potential for exploiting bugs in 3D rendering engines grows.19 Malformed U3D data can be used to achieve remote code execution, often bypassed by traditional scanners that do not perform deep parsing of these specialized object streams.2

| Feature | PRC (ISO 14739\) | U3D (ECMA-363) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Representation Type | Hybrid (B-rep \+ Mesh) | Tessellation (Mesh) 21 |
| Geometric Precision | High / Exact | Variable / Limited 21 |
| Compression | Medium to Light | Light (High Compression) 21 |
| Common Vulnerabilities | Array Overflow, Logic Errors | Memory Corruption, Buffer Overflow 22 |

## **Generative AI and the Future of Metamorphic PDF Malware**

The most disruptive trend emerging in 2025 is the use of generative AI to create autonomous and metamorphic malware. Attackers are no longer limited to static variations of a single payload; instead, they are experimenting with AI models that can dynamically alter their behavior mid-execution to evade detection.23 One such experimental dropper, tracked as "PROMPTFLUX," suggests that threat actors are using LLMs to develop dynamic obfuscation techniques that generate unique malicious functions on demand.23

This shift toward AI-generated malware presents a severe challenge to existing security measures. Traditional static analysis and signature-based detection are rapidly losing their efficacy as attackers mass-produce polymorphic versions that are syntactically different but functionally identical.24 In response, the research community is turning to GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) and Diffusion-based models to generate synthetic malware samples to augment imbalanced datasets, improving the classification of rare malware classes by up to 60%.25

## **Datasets and Metadata for Modern Detection Development**

For developers building security tools, the "Evasive-PDFMal2022" dataset and its 2024 extensions provide a critical resource for training machine learning models against modern techniques.27 This dataset contains 10,025 records, specifically curated to include files that evade common significant features used by standard learning algorithms.27

### **Technical Features for PDF Classification**

Modern detection frameworks rely on 37 static features, divided into general and structural categories, to identify malicious intent:

* **General Features:** Metadata size, document encryption status, number of pages (malicious PDFs often contain only one blank page), and the presence of a valid PDF header.27  
* **Structural Features:** Keyword counts for /JS, /JavaScript, /URI, /Action, /OpenAction, /Launch, /Acroform, and /XFA.27  
* **Obfuscation Markers:** The presence of nested filters (e.g., /FlateDecode combined with /JBIG2Decode) and a high count of indirect objects or malformed /Xref tables.27

Research indicates that random forest algorithms and ensemble learning techniques, when trained on these enriched datasets, can achieve accuracy rates as high as 98-99.95%, with minimal false positive rates.22

### **Verified Malicious Variants and CVE References**

The following table provides a reference for specific malicious variants and exploitation methods included in recent verified research datasets:

| Malicious Variant / CVE | Exploitation Mechanism | Target Application / API |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| CVE-2017-7442 | Unauthorized File Write / Execution | Nitro Reader JS API 22 |
| CVE-2010-1240 | Metasploit Payload Injection | Adobe PDF Embedded EXE 22 |
| EDB-ID-16621 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | Foxit Title Field 22 |
| CVE-2014-0514 | Insecure Native Interface | Adobe Reader JS (v \< 11.2) 22 |
| CVE-2013-2729 | Heap Corruption in BMP/RLE | Adobe Reader Image Parser 22 |
| CVE-2020-7374 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | Documalis JPEG Parser 22 |

## **Forensic Analysis Infrastructure: MALVADA and SaMOSA**

To analyze these complex threats, modern security researchers utilize automated dynamic analysis pipelines. The MALVADA framework, for instance, uses the CAPEv2 sandbox to execute malware in a controlled virtual environment, generating standardized JSON execution traces that capture API calls, network activity, and system resource usage.30 Furthermore, tools like SaMOSA incorporate microarchitectural side-channels, such as Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs), to detect malicious behaviors that remain invisible to OS-level monitoring.31

This level of instrumentation is necessary to detect evolved evasion techniques that rely on the absence of specific auxiliary files or "shadow" components. If a sample is submitted to a sandbox in isolation without its required ZIP or archive contents, it may terminate gracefully before detonating, a tactic frequently observed in government-targeted phishing campaigns in 2025\.32

## **Technical Recommendations and Future Outlook**

The research indicates that as detection capabilities evolve, attackers will increasingly turn to AI-autonomous agents that can execute full kill chains—reconnaissance, exploitation, and exfiltration—without human intervention.33 To remain resilient, security tools must move beyond reactive measures and adopt proactive strategies:

* **Implement Differential Fuzzing:** To mitigate parser ambiguity, detection engines should compare rendering outputs across multiple PDF viewers (Adobe, Foxit, Chrome) to identify "Chameleon" structural inconsistencies.6  
* **Integrate CDR Pipelines:** Neutralize passive execution triggers by sanitizing PDF streams, stripping out active content, and regenerating the document using only approved non-executable elements.17  
* **Employ Forced Dynamic Execution:** Use modified engines like FV8 to compel the execution of obfuscated and environmentally-keyed JavaScript, ensuring full coverage of the malicious logic.11  
* **Invest in Crypto-Agility:** Prepare for the disruption of encryption standards by quantum computing, as attackers will eventually leverage these advancements to hide payloads within next-generation encrypted streams.34

The future of PDF security lies in the synthesis of human expertise with autonomous, AI-driven defense systems capable of adapting to the metamorphic and deceptive nature of tomorrow's document-based threats.33
