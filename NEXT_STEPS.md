# Next Steps (2026-01-31)

1. Stage 7 artefacts stay current: continue logging instrumentation updates (e.g., `docs/performance.md`, `docs/analysis.md`) whenever new fixture runs or regression notes emerge.
2. Stage 7.5 query coverage is anchored in `crates/sis-pdf/src/commands/query.rs:7238-7327` and `docs/query-predicates.md`, so keep extending those references if additional shortcuts/composite filters land.
3. Stage 8 is complete (ML exports verified, docs updated); turn focus to Stage 9 by preparing `correlations` dashboards, JSONL pipelines, and any placeholder docs so the cross-finding exports can ship smoothly.
