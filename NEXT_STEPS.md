# Next Steps (2026-01-30)

1. Wire the rich-media query surface + feature-vector fields (`swf`, `swf.actionscript`, `media.3d`, `media.audio`, etc.) so the new metadata and detections can be surfaced through the CLI and ML pipelines.
2. Add the remaining SWF/3D/audio unit tests referenced in `plans/20260120-next-analysis-phases.md` (decompression limit, size limit, media detection, query coverage) to prove the extended heuristics before moving into Stage 5.
