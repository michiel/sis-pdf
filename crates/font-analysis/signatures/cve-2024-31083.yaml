- cve_id: CVE-2024-31083
  description: A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the ProcRenderAddGlyphs() function of Xorg servers. This issue occurs when AllocateGlyph() is called to store new glyphs sent by the client to the X server, potentially resulting in multiple entries pointing to the same non-refcounted glyphs. Consequently, ProcRenderAddGlyphs() may free a glyph, leading to a use-after-free scenario when the same glyph pointer is subsequently accessed. This flaw allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system by sending a specially crafted request.
  severity: high
  pattern:
    type: manual
    note: This signature requires manual review and pattern definition. See IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md section 2.4 for pattern types.
