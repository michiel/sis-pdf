- cve_id: CVE-2025-27163
  description: "hmtx table length is smaller than required based on hhea.numberOfHMetrics, leading to out-of-bounds reads"
  severity: high
  signature_rationale: |
    The hmtx (horizontal metrics) table must contain at least numberOfHMetrics * 4 bytes
    of data, as specified in the hhea table. When the hmtx table length is smaller than
    required, parsers performing out-of-bounds reads can access invalid memory, potentially
    leading to crashes or information disclosure.
  match_logic: all
  patterns:
    - type: table_length_mismatch
      table1: hmtx
      table2: hhea
      condition: "table1.length < 4 * table2.num_metrics"
