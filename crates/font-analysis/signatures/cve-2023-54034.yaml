- cve_id: CVE-2023-54034
  description: |-
    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

    iommufd: Make sure to zero vfio_iommu_type1_info before copying to user

    Missed a zero initialization here. Most of the struct is filled with
    a copy_from_user(), however minsz for that copy is smaller than the
    actual struct by 8 bytes, thus we don't fill the padding.
  severity: medium
  pattern:
    type: manual
    note: This signature requires manual review and pattern definition. See IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md section 2.4 for pattern types.
