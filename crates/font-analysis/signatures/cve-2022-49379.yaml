    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

    driver core: Fix wait_for_device_probe() & deferred_probe_timeout interaction

    Mounting NFS rootfs was timing out when deferred_probe_timeout was
    non-zero [1].  This was because ip_auto_config() initcall times out
    waiting for the network interfaces to show up when
    deferred_probe_timeout was non-zero. While ip_auto_config() calls
    wait_for_device_probe() to make sure any currently running deferred
    probe work or asynchronous probe finishes, that wasn't sufficient to
    account for devices being deferred until deferred_probe_timeout.

    Commit 35a672363ab3 ("driver core: Ensure wait_for_device_probe() waits
    until the deferred_probe_timeout fires") tried to fix that by making
    sure wait_for_device_probe() waits for deferred_probe_timeout to expire
    before returning.

    However, if wait_for_device_probe() is called from the kernel_init()
    context:

    - Before deferred_probe_initcall() [2], it causes the boot process to
      hang due to a deadlock.

    - After deferred_probe_initcall() [3], it blocks kernel_init() from
      continuing till deferred_probe_timeout expires and beats the point of
      deferred_probe_timeout that's trying to wait for userspace to load
      modules.

    Neither of this is good. So revert the changes to
    wait_for_device_probe().
