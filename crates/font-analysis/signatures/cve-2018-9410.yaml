- cve_id: CVE-2018-9410
  description: In analyzeAxes of FontUtils.cpp, there is a possible out of bounds read due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.
  severity: medium
  signature_rationale: |
    This vulnerability occurs in Android's Minikin library when the analyzeAxes function
    processes variable fonts (OpenType fonts with variation axes). The function reads axis
    records from the fvar (Font Variations) table without validating that the offsets stay
    within the table boundaries. When a malformed fvar table contains axis record offsets
    that extend beyond the table length, the parser performs out-of-bounds memory reads,
    leading to information disclosure. The offset_out_of_bounds pattern detects this by
    checking whether axis_records field offsets exceed the fvar table_length boundary.
  match_logic: all
  patterns:
    - type: offset_out_of_bounds
      table: fvar
      field: axis_records
      bounds: table_length
