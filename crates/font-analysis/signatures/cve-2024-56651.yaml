- cve_id: CVE-2024-56651
  description: |-
    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

    can: hi311x: hi3110_can_ist(): fix potential use-after-free

    The commit a22bd630cfff ("can: hi311x: do not report txerr and rxerr
    during bus-off") removed the reporting of rxerr and txerr even in case
    of correct operation (i. e. not bus-off).

    The error count information added to the CAN frame after netif_rx() is
    a potential use after free, since there is no guarantee that the skb
    is in the same state. It might be freed or reused.

    Fix the issue by postponing the netif_rx() call in case of txerr and
    rxerr reporting.
  severity: high
