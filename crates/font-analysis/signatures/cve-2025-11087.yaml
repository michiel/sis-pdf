- cve_id: CVE-2025-11087

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
  severity: high
  pattern:
    type: manual
    note: This signature requires manual review and pattern definition. See IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md section 2.4 for pattern types.
