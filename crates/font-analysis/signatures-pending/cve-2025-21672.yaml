- cve_id: CVE-2025-21672
  description: |-
    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

    afs: Fix merge preference rule failure condition

    syzbot reported a lock held when returning to userspace[1].  This is
    because if argc is less than 0 and the function returns directly, the held
    inode lock is not released.

    Fix this by store the error in ret and jump to done to clean up instead of
    returning directly.

    [dh: Modified Lizhi Xu's original patch to make it honour the error code
    from afs_split_string()]

    [1]
