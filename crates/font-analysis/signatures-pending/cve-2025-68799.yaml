- cve_id: CVE-2025-68799
  description: |-
    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

    caif: fix integer underflow in cffrml_receive()

    The cffrml_receive() function extracts a length field from the packet
    header and, when FCS is disabled, subtracts 2 from this length without
    validating that len >= 2.

    If an attacker sends a malicious packet with a length field of 0 or 1
    to an interface with FCS disabled, the subtraction causes an integer
    underflow.

    This can lead to memory exhaustion and kernel instability, potential
    information disclosure if padding contains uninitialized kernel memory.

    Fix this by validating that len >= 2 before performing the subtraction.
  severity: medium

    type: manual
    note: This signature requires manual review and pattern definition. See IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md section 2.4 for pattern types.
