- cve_id: CVE-2022-49948
  description: |-
    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

    vt: Clear selection before changing the font

    When changing the console font with ioctl(KDFONTOP) the new font size
    can be bigger than the previous font. A previous selection may thus now
    be outside of the new screen size and thus trigger out-of-bounds
    accesses to graphics memory if the selection is removed in
    vc_do_resize().

    Prevent such out-of-memory accesses by dropping the selection before the
    various con_font_set() console handlers are called.
  severity: high
  pattern:
    type: manual
    note: This signature requires manual review and pattern definition. See IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md section 2.4 for pattern types.
