    nscd: Null pointer crashes after notfound response

    If the Name Service Cache Daemon's (nscd) cache fails to add a not-found
    netgroup response to the cache, the client request can result in a null
    pointer dereference.  This flaw was introduced in glibc 2.15 when the
    cache was added to nscd.

    This vulnerability is only present in the nscd binary.
