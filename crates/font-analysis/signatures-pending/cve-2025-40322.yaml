- cve_id: CVE-2025-40322
  description: |-
    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

    fbdev: bitblit: bound-check glyph index in bit_putcs*

    bit_putcs_aligned()/unaligned() derived the glyph pointer from the
    character value masked by 0xff/0x1ff, which may exceed the actual font's
    glyph count and read past the end of the built-in font array.
    Clamp the index to the actual glyph count before computing the address.

    This fixes a global out-of-bounds read reported by syzbot.
  severity: medium
  pattern:
    type: manual
    note: This signature requires manual review and pattern definition. See IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md section 2.4 for pattern types.
