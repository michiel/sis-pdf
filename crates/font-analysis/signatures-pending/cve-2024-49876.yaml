    drm/xe: fix UAF around queue destruction

    We currently do stuff like queuing the final destruction step on a
    random system wq, which will outlive the driver instance. With bad
    timing we can teardown the driver with one or more work workqueue still
    being alive leading to various UAF splats. Add a fini step to ensure
    user queues are properly torn down. At this point GuC should already be
    nuked so queue itself should no longer be referenced from hw pov.

    v2 (Matt B)
     - Looks much safer to use a waitqueue and then just wait for the
       xa_array to become empty before triggering the drain.
