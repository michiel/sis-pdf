# Test Fixtures

This directory contains synthetic PDF fixtures used by the test suite. Fixtures are intentionally minimal and do not include live malware or exploit payloads. The goal is to exercise parser and detector behaviour in a controlled way.

If fixtures are generated by scripts, ensure the script is deterministic and committed alongside the generated PDFs.
