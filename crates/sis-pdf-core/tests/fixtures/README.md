# Test Fixtures

This directory contains synthetic PDF fixtures used by the test suite.

It also includes a small `corpus_captured/` subset captured from local corpus triage for regression locking of behaviour that was observed in the field. These PDFs remain untrusted inputs and must be handled as hostile test artefacts.

`parser_diff_hazards/` contains deterministic synthetic fixtures for secondary-parser hazard metadata (`creation_date_trailing_timezone_token`, `unbalanced_literal_string_parentheses`) so coverage remains stable when corpus samples drift.

If fixtures are generated by scripts, ensure the script is deterministic and committed alongside the generated PDFs.
