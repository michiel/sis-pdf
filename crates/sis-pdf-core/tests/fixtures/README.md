# Test Fixtures

This directory contains synthetic PDF fixtures used by the test suite.

It also includes a small `corpus_captured/` subset captured from local corpus triage for regression locking of behaviour that was observed in the field. These PDFs remain untrusted inputs and must be handled as hostile test artefacts.

If fixtures are generated by scripts, ensure the script is deterministic and committed alongside the generated PDFs.
