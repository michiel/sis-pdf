  "notes": "Full mshta-to-PowerShell kill chain: PDF opens -> Italian-language JS alert -> OpenAction -> Launch(mshta) -> PowerShell cradle. Post-uplift validation (2026-02-28): `/Launch /Win` fields are parsed (`launch.win.f/p/d/o`) and `launch_win_embedded_url` now extracts the Blogspot C2 URL as a dedicated finding. Residual chain gap: social-engineering JS and renderer-evasion signals are still split across separate chains rather than one canonical end-to-end narrative."
