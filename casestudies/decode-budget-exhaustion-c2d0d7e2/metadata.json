  "notes": "Runtime-profiled deep scan shows a severe hotspot in content_first_stage1 (~33.0s of 33.7s total). Non-fatal decode_budget_exceeded warnings repeat heavily in telemetry, but the kind is not emitted as a stable finding in report JSON, creating observability drift between logs and findings. Chain output is mostly singleton despite high finding volume."
